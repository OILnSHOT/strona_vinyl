        <p class="main__text">
          AC/DC were formed in 1973 in Australia by guitarist Malcolm Young
          after his previous band, the Velvet Underground, collapsed (no
          relation to the seminal American group). With his younger brother
          Angus serving as lead guitarist, the band played some gigs around
          Sydney. Angus was only 18 at the time, and his sister suggested that
          he wear his school uniform on-stage; the look became the band's visual
          trademark. While still in Sydney, the original lineup featuring singer
          Dave Evans cut a single called "Can I Sit Next to You," with
          ex-Easybeats Harry Vanda and George Young (Malcolm and Angus' older

            Brian Francis Johnson - is an English singer and songwriter. In
            1980, after the death of Bon Scott, he became the third lead singer
            of the Australian rock band AC/DC. He and the rest of the band were
            inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003. In March 2016,
            he stepped down from touring on the Rock or Bust World Tour due to
            hearing problems. He stated in an interview that he "had a pretty
            good run" in AC/DC and implied that he might not be returning. On
            September 30, 2020, AC/DC officially confirmed that Johnson along
            with fellow band mates Phil Rudd and Cliff Williams returned to
            record the band's 2020 album, Power Up in August 2018.
