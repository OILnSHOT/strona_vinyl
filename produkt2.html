        <p class="main__text">
          Metalica is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981
          in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars
          Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career.
          The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made
          them one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside
          Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises
          founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime
          lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist
          Dave Mustaine (who went on to form Megadeth after being fired from the
          band) and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton (who died in a bus
          accident in Sweden in 1986) and Jason Newsted are former members of
          the band.
